1. Pitch Type - B (starts on ds-a) or C (starts on d-bf) = as is, b c

2. Octave - there are 7 total (D=deep, H=high) = DDD DD D DH H HH HHH

3. Direction - 2 possible, low-high (Forward), and high-low (Reverse) = F R

4. Rhythm - 8=V (very tiny), 8.=T (tiny) 4=S (small), 4.=M (medium), 2=L (long)
Abbr. to # of 8th notes:
L=4
